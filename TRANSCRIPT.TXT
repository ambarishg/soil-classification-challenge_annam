Approach of solving the problem

Challenge 1 :
The Soil Image Classification Challenge is a machine learning competition organized by Annam.ai at IIT Ropar, serving as an initial task for shortlisted hackathon participants. 
Competitors will build models to classify each soil image into one of four categories: Alluvial soil, Black soil, Clay soil, or Red soil.Â 

Pretrained Models with custom heads have been used with 5-fold cross validation and image size of 512
Models used are 
resnext50_32x4d
EfficientnetB3
EfficientnetB5
EfficientnetB7
Vision Transformer Patch 16 384


Challenge 2

The Soil Image Classification Challenge is a machine learning competition organized by Annam.ai at IIT Ropar, serving as an initial task for shortlisted hackathon participants.
Competitors will build models to classify the images to if they're soil image or not.

We follow a autoencoder architecture to  train the images

The anomalies are detected using the reconstruction error

Top 5% are counted as anomalies

Backbone used
EfficientnetB0 , EfficientnetB1 ,EfficientnetB3 , EfficientnetB5
Simple Auto Encoder
